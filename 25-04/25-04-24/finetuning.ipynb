    "OpenCL is a programming model that provides data transmission among multiple processors executing on heterogeneous devices, including graphics processors (GPUs) and CPUs. The data used in execution of OpenCL algorithms is stored and transmitted in parallel in memory. A single message is transmitted through the data exchange pipeline between these devices. Local memory is a special kind of memory in OpenCL that is used only for inter-device communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCL, local memory refers to a system-defined or device-defined buffer that is physically located (i.e., residing on the local device) but is not shared with other devices in the same context. It supports simple exchange of data, including intra- and inter-device-communication transactions between OpenCL devices. In OpenCL, the size of a local buffer dimension is 1, but the buffer instance can refer to more than one buffer at the same time, so the maximum buffer dimension is expected to be a power of two.\n",
